## Things I learned or get familiar in the process of making this game :
#### 1- Get familiar with Unity Game Engine.
#### 2- Get familiar with physics in unity.
#### 3- Get familiar with materials/components/particles in unity (aim assistant, reaction when a monster dies, etc...).
#### 4- Get familiar with scripts (Simple level controller - Control bird and monsters behaviors).
#### 5- Get familiar with Cinemachine (Focus camera on main character and monsters).
#### 6- and some other stuff that i don't remember now :)

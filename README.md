## Things I learned during the process of making this game :
#### 1- I get familiar with Unity Game Engine.
#### 2- I get familiar with physics in unity.
#### 3- I get familiar with materials/components/particles in unity (aim assistant, reaction when a monster dies, etc...).
#### 4- I get familiar with scripts (Simple level controller - Control bird and monsters behaviours).
#### 5- I get familiar with Cinemachine (Focus camera on main character and monsters).
#### 6- and some other stuff that I don't remember now :)
I could not upload here because the size of the file is more than the allowed upload size :(

but you can download the game on my telegram channel (for Windows OS) : <a href="https://t.me/+xgs2RAEpwn03ZGM0">MyTelegramChannel</a>

Good luck :)
